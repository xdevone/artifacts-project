 <div id="panel" class="ex1">Rice D. Montague (1801-1877) was Montgomery County clerk of court  from 1831 until 1858. He was a member of the House of Delegates from 1859-1861. Montague also had an active business life, manufacturing and bottling horse liniment made by his own recipe in a factory behind his house at 109 East Main Street by the 1870s. The sheepskin leather account book was an 1866(?) Christmas gift  to Rice D. Montague from his son-in-law Judge George Junkin. It contains detailed financial records dating from about 1867 through about 1870 pertaining to his business, agricultural, and personal life. The full extent of the information is unknown due to the poor condition of the book. As one of the countyâ€™s preeminent nineteenth century citizens, the account book can help to illustrate this important man as well as business and daily life of the era.</div>
